Only terminate your turn when you are sure that the problem is solved. \n\nSolve the following problem step by step. You now have the ability to selectively write executable Python code to enhance your reasoning process. The Python code will be executed by an external sandbox. \n\nYou MUST plan extensively before each function call, and reflect extensively on the outcomes of the previous function calls. DO NOT do this entire process by making function calls only, as this can impair your ability to solve the problem and think insightfully.\n\nFor all the provided images, in order, the i-th image has already been read into the global variable `image_clue_i` using the PIL.Image.open() function. When writing Python code, you can directly use these variables without needing to read them again.\n\nSince you are dealing with the vision-related question answering task, you MUST use the python tool (e.g., matplotlib library) to analyze or transform images whenever it could improve your understanding or aid your reasoning. This includes but is not limited to zooming in, rotating, adjusting contrast, computing statistics, or isolating features. \n\nNote that when you use matplotlib to visualize data or further process images, you need to use plt.show() to display these images; there is no need to save them. Do not use image processing libraries like cv2 or PIL. If you want to check the value of a variable, you MUST use print() to check it.\n\nThe output (wrapped in `<interpreter>output_str</interpreter>`) can be returned to aid your reasoning and help you arrive at the final answer. The Python code should be complete scripts, including necessary imports. \nEach code snippet is wrapped with `<code>\n```python\ncode snippet\n```\n</code>`.\nThe last part of your response should be in the following format:\n<answer>\n\\boxed{'The final answer goes here.'}\n</answer>\n\n*image resolution:*\n\nImage Width: 299; Image Height: 299\n\n*user question:*\nAnswer the following Problem with an image provided and put the answer in the format of \\boxed{answer}\n\nDetermine whether the eye axis in this image is horizontal or vertical?\nA.Sagittal eye axis\nB.Transverse eye axis\nC.Bent eye axis\nD.Crooked eye axis\n\nRemember to place the final answer in the last part using the format: \n<answer>\n\\boxed{'The final answer goes here.'}\n</answer>"

This often corresponds to the main direction of the blood vessels or the location of the optic disc and fovea.\n   - The optic disc is usually a bright spot, and the fovea is a darker spot.\n   - Draw a line between these two anatomical landmarks to infer the axis.\n   - If this line is horizontal, the axis is transverse; if vertical, it is sagittal.\n\n3. **How to Analyze the Image**:\n   - Visualize the image and look for the optic disc (bright spot) and fovea (darker spot).\n   - Optionally, enhance contrast to make features more visible.\n   - Estimate the orientation of the line connecting the optic disc and fovea.\n\n4. **Use matplotlib to visualize the image and possibly annotate it**.\n   - Mark the suspected optic disc and fovea.\n   - Draw a line between them and calculate its angle.\n\n5. **Interpret the angle**:\n   - If the line is closer to horizontal, it's transverse.\n   - If it's closer to vertical, it's sagittal.\n   - If it's neither, it's bent or crooked.\n\nLet's start by visualizing the image and enhancing contrast to better see the features.\n\n<code>\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Convert image to numpy array for analysis\nimg = np.array(image_clue_0)\n\n# Show the image with enhanced contrast to help spot anatomical landmarks\nplt.figure(figsize=(5,5))\nplt.imshow(img, cmap='gray')\nplt.title(\"Original Retinal Image\")\nplt.axis('off')\nplt.show()\n\n# Enhance contrast by stretching intensity\nimg_min = img.min()\nimg_max = img.max()\nimg_enhanced = (img - img_min) / (img_max - img_min) * 255\nimg_enhanced = img_enhanced.astype(np.uint8)\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(5,5))\nplt.imshow(img_enhanced, cmap='gray')\nplt.title(\"Enhanced Contrast Retinal Image\")\nplt.axis('off')\nplt.show()\n```\n</code>\n"

Let's reflect on what we see:\n\n- The **optic disc** is typically a bright circular spot, which in this image is located on the right side.\n- The **fovea** is a darker spot, slightly to the left of the optic disc.\n- The main blood vessels radiate from the optic disc, spreading horizontally across the image.\n\nTo determine the axis:\n- If we draw a line from the optic disc (right) to the fovea (center-left), does this line run horizontally or vertically?\n- Visually, the line is mostly horizontal.\n\nTo be thorough, let's plot the image and annotate the suspected optic disc and fovea positions, then draw a line between them and compute its angle to confirm if the axis is horizontal (transverse) or vertical (sagittal).\n\nLet's estimate the coordinates:\n- Optic disc: right side, let's say (x=250, y=150)\n- Fovea: center-left, let's say (x=130, y=150)\n\nLet's plot these points and the line.\n\n<code>\n```python\nplt.figure(figsize=(5,5))\nplt.imshow(img_enhanced, cmap='gray')\nplt.scatter([250, 130], [150, 150], c=['yellow', 'red'], s=80, label='Landmarks')\nplt.plot([250, 130], [150, 150], 'g-', linewidth=2, label='Axis')\nplt.legend(['Estimated Eye Axis', 'Optic Disc', 'Fovea'], loc='lower right')\nplt.title(\"Estimated Eye Axis\")\nplt.axis('off')\nplt.show()\n\n# Calculate angle of the axis\nimport math\ndx = 250 - 130\ndy = 150 - 150\nangle = math.degrees(math.atan2(dy, dx))\nprint(f\"Angle of axis (degrees): {angle}\")\n```\n</code>\n"
