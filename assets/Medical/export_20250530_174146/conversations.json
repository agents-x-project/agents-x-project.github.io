Only terminate your turn when you are sure that the problem is solved. \n\nSolve the following problem step by step. You now have the ability to selectively write executable Python code to enhance your reasoning process. The Python code will be executed by an external sandbox. \n\nYou MUST plan extensively before each function call, and reflect extensively on the outcomes of the previous function calls. DO NOT do this entire process by making function calls only, as this can impair your ability to solve the problem and think insightfully.\n\nFor all the provided images, in order, the i-th image has already been read into the global variable `image_clue_i` using the PIL.Image.open() function. When writing Python code, you can directly use these variables without needing to read them again.\n\nSince you are dealing with the vision-related question answering task, you MUST use the python tool (e.g., matplotlib library) to analyze or transform images whenever it could improve your understanding or aid your reasoning. This includes but is not limited to zooming in, rotating, adjusting contrast, computing statistics, or isolating features. \n\nNote that when you use matplotlib to visualize data or further process images, you need to use plt.show() to display these images; there is no need to save them. Do not use image processing libraries like cv2 or PIL. If you want to check the value of a variable, you MUST use print() to check it.\n\nThe output (wrapped in `<interpreter>output_str</interpreter>`) can be returned to aid your reasoning and help you arrive at the final answer.

        "value": "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Question**\nThe question asks whether the \"eye axis\" in this retinal image is horizontal, vertical, angled, wavy, or curved. The \"eye axis\" typically refers to the main orientation of the retina, often defined by the line connecting the optic disc and the macula or fovea.\n\n**Step 2: Analyzing the Image**\n- The optic disc is usually a brighter, yellowish area, often to one side.\n- The macula or fovea is a darker, central spot.\n- The axis is the notional line between these two points.\n\n**Step 3: Planning the Analysis**\nTo determine the axis:\n1. Visualize the image to locate the optic disc and macula/fovea.\n2. If needed, increase contrast to make features more visible.\n3. Draw a line between the optic disc and fovea and determine its orientation:\n    - Horizontal: left to right\n    - Vertical: top to bottom\n    - Angled: diagonal\n    - Wavy/curved: not a straight line\n\n**Step 4: Execute Preliminary Visualization**\nLet's visualize the image, possibly with contrast adjustment, to identify key features.\n\n<code>\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Show original image\nplt.figure(figsize=(6,6))\nplt.imshow(image_clue_0)\nplt.title(\"Original Retinal Image\")\nplt.axis('off')\nplt.show()\n\n# Enhance contrast for better feature visualization\nfrom matplotlib.colors import Normalize\n\nimg_arr = np.array(image_clue_0)\n# Normalize for better visibility\nnormed_img = (img_arr - img_arr.min()) / (img_arr.max() - img_arr.min())\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(6,6))\nplt.imshow(normed_img)\nplt.title(\"Contrast Enhanced Retinal Image\")\nplt.axis('off')\nplt.show()\n```\n</code>\n"

This line is not vertical (top-to-bottom) nor perfectly horizontal, but rather is angled from the right edge toward the center-left of the image.\n\nLet's confirm this by plotting a line between the optic disc and fovea on the image and measuring the angle of this axis.\n\n**Planning:**\n1. Estimate the coordinates of the optic disc and fovea.\n2. Plot a line between them.\n3. Calculate the angle of the line relative to the horizontal.\n\nLet's proceed to estimate and plot these features.\n\n<code>\n```python\n# Estimate coordinates\n# From the image, optic disc is on the right edge, say (260, 150)\n# Fovea is the dark spot left of center, say (90, 120)\noptic_disc = (260, 150)\nfovea = (90, 120)\n\n# Plot these on the image\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(6,6))\nax.imshow(normed_img)\nax.scatter(*optic_disc, color='yellow', s=100, label='Optic Disc')\nax.scatter(*fovea, color='red', s=100, label='Fovea')\nax.plot([optic_disc[0], fovea[0]], [optic_disc[1], fovea[1]], color='lime', linewidth=2, label='Eye Axis')\nax.legend()\nplt.title(\"Estimated Eye Axis\")\nplt.axis('off')\nplt.show()\n\n# Compute angle with respect to the horizontal axis\nimport math\ndx = fovea[0] - optic_disc[0]\ndy = fovea[1] - optic_disc[1]\nangle_deg = math.degrees(math.atan2(dy, dx))\nprint(f\"Angle of eye axis with respect to horizontal: {angle_deg:.2f} degrees\")\n```\n</code>\n"
