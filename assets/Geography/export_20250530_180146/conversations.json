We do not yet know the real-world scale (meters per pixel), so we should check for features (e.g., standard house size, roads) to estimate scale.\n\n2. **Visual Inspection:**  \n   - Visually identify the residential areas (houses/buildings) in the image.\n   - Estimate the number and approximate size of residential objects.\n\n3. **Estimate Scale:**  \n   - Use a recognizable feature (e.g., typical width of a residential road, driveway, or house) to estimate the real-world pixel scale.\n   - A typical suburban house is about 10-15 meters wide; a residential road is about 6-8 meters wide.\n\n4. **Segment Residential Areas:**  \n   - Use basic image processing to isolate and segment the areas covered by buildings.\n   - This could involve color thresholding, edge detection, or manual bounding box estimation.\n\n5. **Calculate Area in Pixels:**  \n   - Count the number of pixels occupied by residential areas.\n\n6. **Convert Pixel Area to m²:**  \n   - Use the estimated scale to convert pixel area to square meters.\n\n7. **Summarize and Box the Answer:**  \n   - Present the final area in the required format.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Visualize the Image\n\nFirst, let's display the image to get a sense of the scene and features.
